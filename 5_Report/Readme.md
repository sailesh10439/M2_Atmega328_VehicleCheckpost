   <h1> VEHICLE CHECKPOST SYSTEM </h1>
<h2> ABSTRACT: </h2>

Vehicle Checkpost is a project, which is used to check weather the vechicles are coming are not. And it can also make a sound when the documents are verified to open a gate. It can store the previous data in database and it reduces the work for human beings. In this project the ultrasonic sensor, dc motor and buzzer is used with the help of <i><b>Atmega328 microcontroller</b></i>. Ultrasonic sensor is used to detect the vehicle. Buzzer is used to make sound to give the signal to open the gate when the documents are verified and DC motor will help to open gate when the buzzer is ON.

<h2> OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROJECT: </h2>

A Vehicle Checkpost system is a simple project, based on ultrasonic sensor using Atmega328p microcontroller, which it detects the vehicle at a certain distance and shows a message that vechicle is comming.

<h2> INTRODUCTION: </h2>

An ultrasonic sensor is an essential component used in-vehicle checkpost system.When a vehicle comes to near checkpost it shows that the vehicle is comming, then the police man will check the vehicle's licence and rc etc. If these are verified then the buzzer will be ON then the gate will be open with the help of DC Motor.

<h2> CATEGORY: </h2>

Sensors used to detect the vehicles that they are comming or not.

<h2> SENSOR MAINTENANCE: </h2>

Based on the Vehicle checkpost system, we can able to modify the distance to deetect the object(may increase or decrease the distance). We can increase the buzzer sound too.

<h2> COMPONENTS AND SUPPLIES: </h2>

<h2> 4W & H (WHO,WHAT,WHEN,WHERE,HOW): </h2>

<h3> WHO: </h3>
   An Ultrasonic sensor is used to detect the vehicles near the sensor.

<h3> WHAT: </h3>
   High Reliability.

<h3> WHEN: </h3>
   It can be be used any time mostly.

<h3> WHERE: </h3>
   Presence of near by vehicles.

<h3> HOW: </h3>
  
 Easy to use and adjusted in a short range.

<h2> SWOT(STRENGTH,WEAKNESS,OPPORTUNITY,THREATS): </h2>

<h3> STRENGTH: </h3>

- It is less in cost.
- We can choose <i> <b> Buzzer </i> </b> to send signal.

<h3> WEAKNESS: </h3>

- Limited Range.

<h3> OPPORTUNITY: </h3>

- Internet of Things(IOT).
- AI.

<h3> THREATS: </h3>
- Sensor disconnection.
- Failure of the components.



<h2> ADVANTAGES: </h2>

- Duplication of the vehicle data is avoided.
- Timely alerts ensure that penalties are avoided.
- It can store the previous data.
- Accessing of vehicle documents easy and time saving.
